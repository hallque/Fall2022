        "\n",
        "[Python][1] is an open-source, high-level, general purpose programming language that was originally developed by [Guido van Rossum][gv]. [What this means][2] is that anyone can view (and optionally make contributions to) the actual language implementation, the language simplifies many tasks for the programmer, especially when compared to other programming languages like C or Java, and Python programs can easily be developed to tackle a wide range of problems including network communication, scientific calculations, data processing and archiving tasks, and graphical tool development. In addition, the syntax and form of the Python programming language is designed to allow Python programs to be quickly developed, simplifying development time and costs while also reducing maintenance costs since a well-written Python program is easy to comprehend.\n",

        "A large number of Python modules, which extend the base programming language, have been developed and are now widely used. These modules, which can simplify the development of new Python programs, can be broadly classified into three types. The first type are commonly used modules that are part of the official Python distribution, known as the [standard library][sl], such as the [`math`][i], [`os.path`][ii], [`pickle`][ip], [`sqlite3`][sql], [`bz2`][iii], or [`csv`][iv] modules. The second type are modules that are also commonly used, but not (yet) part of the official standard library. Relevant example modules of this type are the [`numpy`][np], [`pandas`][pd], [`matplotlib`][mp], or [`scipy`][sp] modules. The last type of module is developed by communities for a special purpose that are currently less commonly used (but this may change in time). These include modules like [`seaborn`][sb], [`statsmodels`][sm], or [`nltk`][nl]. Of course, any developer can write a Python module, thus offering a wide array of possible add-on functionality. Using these modules, however, should be carefully balanced with the importance of minimizing software dependencies, which can reduce development and maintenance issues for software engineers.\n",

        "\n",
        "Python is maintained by the Python Software Foundation and currently comes in [two versions][3]: Python 2 and Python 3. Sometime around the turn of the millennium, [Python developers][4] began to consider improvements to the Python language that might produce incompatibilities with the existing Python language. One such change, which was introduced with Python 3, is that the Python programming language is now consistently object-oriented, which means that everything in a Python program or script is now an _object_. These changes were considered necessary to enable the language to continue to grow and develop. The development of this new version, originally entitled Python 3000 or Python 3K, now shortened to just Python 3 (and even sometimes Python3), took a number of years as new ideas were carefully developed and tested, and to provide sufficient time for the existing community to participate in the progression of the Python language.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, over 15 years later, Python 3 is an improved version of the original Python language and offers a number of [important advances][5]. Thus, Python 2 is primarily used to maintain backwards compatibility with legacy Python codes that are too difficult or expensive to port to the newer version. **In this class, we will exclusively use Python 3** since it represents the future, and all libraries we will use have already been successfully ported to the new version. As you browse different websites, IPython notebooks, or other resources, you should keep in mind this language split and be sure to focus primarily on Python 3 material to minimize confusion arising from these language differences. \n",

        "If lines need to be longer than 80 characters, the recommended practice is to use parentheses to group operations and to use suitable indentation to maintain readability. In the event this is insufficient, a line continuation character, `/`, can be used to allow code to extend over as many lines as necessary. If that sounds confusing, don't worry, you will see examples where this is demonstrated repeatedly in this course.\n",

Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means we do not need to **declare** the data type for a variable. Instead, the Python interpreter determines the data type for a variable by the type of data the variable holds. For example, if a variable holds an integer number like 1, 2, 3, or -10, the variable is of type int. Likewise, if the variable contains a real number like 3.14, the variable is of type float, which is shorthand for floating-point.\n",

In addition, Python provides augmented assignment operators that combine a basic mathematical operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `//`, or `%`) with the assignment operator: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `**=`, `//=`, and `%=`; this can simplify and thus clarify some expressions.
